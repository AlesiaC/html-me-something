            <h1>Focused Attention</h1>
                <p><h3>What is it?</h3>
                <p>Focused Attention is an organizational team that coordinates celebrity needs and movements at larger scale fan based conventions.</p>
    
                <p><h3>How did it start?</h3>
                <p><strong>History:  </strong>Focused Attention started in 1998 when the founder Alesia Clardy was asked to manage
                a group of volunteers scheduled to work with the Celebrity guests at" <a href = "http://www.gencon.com"> Gen Con.</a> The volunteers were non-existent but her friends were plentiful.
                She asked her friends to join her and thats when the team started.</p>

    <p>A few years later in 2002 the Gen Con team worked on the <a href= "http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Celebration_II"> 
         Star Wars Celebration II</a>  held in Indianapolis, IN.  After that event, 
        Mary Franklin a team member of LucasArts suggested that our experienced volunteer group name ourselves. </p>
<p>Alesia looked to her team for suggestions and Rob Nicholls suggested the name Focused Attention.  </p>
<p/>That's when the organization was born.</p>
<p>Gen Con doesn't currently bring in Entertainment Guests, but the team has expanded out to a number of larger scale
    conventions.  The organization becomes part of the convention team and helps them put on the best possible show for the fans.

            helping them they are at an autograph table or making sure they make it on time to their convention committments.  Team Members
            are there to not only make the entertainment guests time run smoothly but also to make the fan experience with the guest be the
